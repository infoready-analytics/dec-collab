# dec-collab
Infoready December 2018 Collab repo

This is going to be slightly more complicated because there are two important
remotes - one is github, where the sharing of the members of the Collab occurs,
and the other is AWS CodeCommit which is where the application under development
(deployed in your account) is hosted.

Keep an eye on slack and we'll work out any issues there.

## How to branch in github

origin == shared github repo hosting

origin/master - team consensus of the best code. pull request your branch onto
master.

origin/feature/x - feature "x" branch mergeable to master.

origin/alilee - personal branch for experimentation. Merge to a feature branch
before merging to master.

## Setup
